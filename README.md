# Demo
Server currently running on beorn machine.

Run the app using the command

flask run --host=0.0.0.0

setting the host to 0.0.0.0 allows other computers to access the app.

After running the server, you should be able to see it at:

machine name:port

Normally the port number is 5000 by default. So, if you run it on the beorn machine it will be 

beorn.csail.mit.edu:5000

Note that some SLS machines don't allow remote connections, such as sls-quad-30, so use a different one.
